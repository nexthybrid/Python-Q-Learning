# Python-Q-Learning
A simple exercise provided by Sentdex. This repository is an exercise version, or student created version by following Sentdex's tutorial:

## Note
The last exercise (creating customized environment and applying DQN) is quite demanding on compute and would take more than 30 hrs to run on a i7-7700k CPU 64GB RAM computer, so in this repo this exercise wasn't executed to the end, but merely testing running. For the results and TensorBoard visualizations, please watch the original video by SentDex where it was trained on a cloud platform and took about five hrs.
